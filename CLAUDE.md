## Development Notes
- use the flux(resources/views/flux) component in the created view
- always explain in Indonesian
- before generating code, study docs/LARAVEL-BEST-PRACTICES.md and docs/LIVEWIRE-BEST-PRACTICES.md and apply them to the generated code.
- the generated code must always be consistent with the existing code.
